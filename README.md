# Checkers
Command line checkers game

# How to use

There are three types of commands  

<b>'R'</b> simulates a game, CPU vs CPU 

<b>'P'</b> starts a 1v1 game  

<b>'CPU'</b> starts a Player vs CPU game

CPU is not that smart btw
You can still lose though

Moving a piece  
Example: 3 1 4 2  
3 1 (row, column) is origin position  
4 2 is destination position
